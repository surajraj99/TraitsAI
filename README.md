In each of these folders is a zip file of all the necessary files that need to be uploaded to lambda in order for the app to work

You'll need to download the raw version of the zip file on to your computer and then unzip. When updating on github, re-upload the bundle zip file (after 'jovo --deploy target zip' AND 'npm run bundle')

For local testing, you'll need to recreate the db.json file. This should automatically be done when you do 'jovo run'.
